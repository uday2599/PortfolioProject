# Covid Visualization Project
Utilized SQL to perform extensive Covid-19 data exploration, including cases, deaths, and vaccinations per day for each country. Calculated important indicators such as Death Percentage and Percent Population Infected. Identified Countries and Continents with the highest death count per population and infection rate. Created a Tableau dashboard for easy visualization of findings.
